 <h1>CreekSide Preserve BeeHive</h1>
 Situated in a small nature preserve, in between two office buildings, the Hive is located over 10 meters (30 feet) above
 the ground in a Douglass Fur tree. It is an important local hive and usually swarms at least twice a year.
 I had an office directly outaside the nest for five years, and was able to observe it over long periods of time.
